# Deep_Learning_for_ShipDetection

This repository contains code and notebooks for ship detection using Sentinel-1 SAR (UNet + VGG16).  
Large data files and trained models are excluded from the repository.

Local files in this folder (ignored by git):
- LabelFinal.tif
- S1_VV_VH_fullSeaShips.tif
- final_ship_unet_model.keras

To run:
1. Keep large data locally or in cloud storage (Google Drive / S3).
2. Open the notebook `UNet_and_VGG16.ipynb` in Colab and mount Drive or point paths to local data.
